# Vehicle Lateral Control

This week, you will learn about how lateral vehicle control ensures that a fixed path through the environment is tracked accurately.
You will see how to define geometry of the path following control problem and develop both 
a simple geometric control and a dynamic model predictive control approach.

**Learning Objectives**

* Define the geometry of the lateral control problem, including heading and cross track errors
* Design a geometric steering controller to track a straight line segment
* Identify the limits of geometric controllers as wheel slip increases
* Explore options for dynamic control, including model predictive control
