# Vehicle Dynamic Modeling

The first task for automating an driverless vehicle is to define a model for how the vehicle moves given steering, throttle and brake commands. This module progresses through a sequence of increasing fidelity physics-based models that are used to design vehicle controllers and motion planners that adhere to the limits of vehicle capabilities.

**Learning Objectives**

* Develop a kinematic bicycle model of a car with velocity and steering angle inputs
* Develop a dynamic bicycle models of a car with velocity and steering angle inputs
* Differentiate between models of tire forces
* Develop a model for actuation in a car, from pedal and steering wheel to tire forces
