## Safety Assurance for Autonomous Vehicles

System architectures for self-driving vehicles are extremely diverse, as no standardized solution has yet emerged. This module describes both the hardware and software architectures commonly used and some of the tradeoffs in terms of cost, reliability, performance and complexity that constrain autonomous vehicle design.

**Learning Objectives**
*. Design an omni-directional multi-sensor system for an autonomous vehicle
*. Describe the basic architecture of a typical self-driving software system
*. Break down the mapping requirements for self-driving cars based on their intended uses.
